      "Donald Trump is the 45th President of the United States, serving from 2017 to 2021. He is a businessman, real estate developer, and television personality who was born on June 14, 1946, in Queens, New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before entering politics, Trump made a name for himself in the business world, building a real estate empire through his company, the Trump Organization. He developed numerous high-profile properties, including the Trump Tower in Manhattan, the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, and the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump also gained fame as a television personality, hosting the reality TV show \"The Apprentice\" from 2004 to 2015. He became known for his catchphrase \"You're fired!\" and his larger-than-life personality.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, running on a platform of populist and nationalist policies. He won the nomination and went on to defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, winning 304 electoral votes to Clinton's 227.\n",
      "\n",
      "As president, Trump implemented several significant policies, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Tax cuts: Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, which lowered corporate and individual tax rates.\n",
      "2. Immigration: Trump implemented a travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim countries and sought to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.\n",
      "3. Healthcare: Trump attempted to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), but was unsuccessful.\n",
      "4. Trade: Trump imposed tariffs on imported goods from countries like China, Mexico, and Canada, sparking trade wars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump's presidency was marked by controversy, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Investigations: Trump faced investigations into his campaign's ties to Russia and allegations of obstruction of justice.\n",
      "2. Impeachment: Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, but was acquitted by the Senate in 2020.\n",
      "3. Social media: Trump was known for his frequent use of Twitter, often using the platform to attack his critics and make controversial statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump lost his re-election bid to Democratic candidate Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, receiving 232 electoral votes to Biden's 306. He left office on January 20, 2021, and has since remained a prominent figure in American politics, continuing to influence the Republican Party and tease a potential 2024 presidential run.\n"
